# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression and Classification

In K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression, the "target value" refers to the value you are trying to predict for a new data point. This target value is also sometimes referred to as the "dependent variable" or the "output variable."

In regression tasks, you have a dataset where each data point consists of features (independent variables) and a corresponding target value (the value you want to predict). KNN regression is used to predict this target value for new, unseen data points based on the values of their features and the target values of their nearest neighbors.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how KNN regression works with the target values:

1. **Choose the Value of K**: You start by choosing a value for K, which determines how many nearest neighbors will be considered when making predictions.

2. **Calculate Distances**: For a new data point with known features but an unknown target value, you calculate the distances between this new data point and all the data points in your training dataset.

3. **Select K Nearest Neighbors**: You then select the K data points with the smallest distances to the new data point. These K data points are the "nearest neighbors."

4. **Predict the Target Value**: In KNN regression, you predict the target value for the new data point by taking the mean (average) of the target values of its K nearest neighbors. The formula for this prediction is:

   \[ \text{Predicted Target Value} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^{K} \text{Target Value of Neighbor } i \]

   This means you simply calculate the average of the target values of the K nearest neighbors, and that average is the predicted target value for the new data point.

So, in KNN regression, you're using the target values of the K nearest neighbors to estimate or predict the target value for the new data point. This method assumes that data points with similar feature values (i.e., nearby neighbors in the feature space) will have similar target values, and the prediction is based on this similarity.
